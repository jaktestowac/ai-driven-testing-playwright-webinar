1. Verify the scenario steps with MCP before implementation to confirm that the planned actions, locators, and flow are correct.


2. Implement exactly one test from the next unimplemented scenario in #file:../../TEST_PLAN.md even if it results in only a partial implementation of the scenario.


3. If the implemented test covers the scenario only partially or reveals missing details, update and enhance the test plan to reflect these gaps.


4. Run all tests after implementation to confirm that no existing tests are broken.


5. Synchronize the status in #file:../../TEST_PLAN.md by clearly marking which parts of each scenario are now covered by automated tests.

6. Add corresponding playwright tags to given test and test cases
